# sexdiff_docker_pure

This repository is used for creating a docker image of RStudio (R3.6.0), including all necessary packages to reproduce analyses for the project Sex Differences in Mice (Zajitschek et al.).
This is *not* the Binder version (which can be found here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)]( https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SusZaj/sexdiffmice_image/master?urlpath=rstudio))
